# Power BI API - Power BI Gateway Data Sample (MSAL)
A sample C# application to authenticate to Azure Active Directory and the Power Platform Service to query Power BI Gateway Agent status for Power BI Gateways in an organization.

The application is a simple console application which makes uses of native .NET libraries as well as the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for authenticating to Azure Active Directory.

This application is only a very basic sample with minimal functionality and not intended for any sort of production use.  It users a username and password to authenticate which are hard-coded in the primary file (this is not a secure way to store credentials)
